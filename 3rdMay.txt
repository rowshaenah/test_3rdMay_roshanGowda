1.The difference b/w overriding and overloading
-->When two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters,
it's called Overloading. When the method signature are the same in the superclass and the child class,
it's called Overriding.
2.if both the functions are static can we override?
-->No, we cannot override static methods because method overriding is based on dynamic binding at 
runtime and the static methods are bonded using static binding at compile time.
3.The difference between final finally and finalize?
-->final-final is the keyword and access modifier which is used to apply restrictions on
a class, method or variable.
finally-finally is the block in Java Exception Handling to execute the important code 
whether the exception occurs or not.
finalize-finalize is the method in Java which is used to perform clean up processing just 
before object is garbage collected.
4.what are maker interfaces?
-->The marker interface pattern is a design pattern in computer science, used with languages
that provide run-time type information about objects. It provides a
means to associate metadata with a class where the language does not have explicit support for such metadata.
5.what is singleton class?
-->Singleton Pattern says that just"define a class that has only one
instance and provides a global point of access to it".
6.what is the underlying data structure for arraylist and linkedlist?
-->Both ArrayList and LinkedList are two different implementations of the List interface. ArrayList is a 
resizable-array implementation, whereas LinkedList is a Doubly-linked list implementation of the List interface.
7.what is hash collision?
-->A collision, or more specifically, a hash code collision in a HashMap, is a situation where two or more key 
objects produce the same final hash value and hence point to the same bucket location or array index.
8.what are lambda expressions?
-->A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions 
are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.
9.what is functional Interface?
-->A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. They can have only one functionality to exhibit. From Java 8 onwards, lambda expressions can be used 
to represent the instance of a functional interface. A functional interface can have any number of default methods.
10.what are optional clases in java 8?
-->Optional is a container object used to contain not-null objects. Optional object is used to represent null with absent value. This class has various utility methods to facilitate 
code to handle values as 'available' or 'not available' instead of checking null values.
